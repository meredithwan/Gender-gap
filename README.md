# Do female college graduates fare worse in the labour market in America?
Using multivariate linear regressions, I investigate whether there is a gender gap among female and male college graduates in America.

The original dataset is available for public use at the National Science Foundation's website: https://ncsesdata.nsf.gov/datadownload/?#

The do file contains the codes that can be used to replicate my analyses as shared in my article published on Medium.

How to use the do file:
1. Download the 2017 NSCG dataset from the abovementioned website
2. Fill in the working directory name (the path where the dataset is saved on your computer)
3. Run the codes

Note: I process my tables in Latex, but if you prefer to use Microsoft Word, be sure to change the export file name from .tex to .doc when exporting result tables using esttab
